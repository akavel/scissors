Function: findDependencies(script, preloaded)

A utility function, which scans a specified Lua script for its dependencies
(by recursively finding the modules loaded with the 'require' function).

Note: the function uses a very simple algorithm for finding the 'require'
function calls, so don't expect it to work with anything but simple strings
as passed to 'require'. Note also that commented out 'require' calls are not ommitted.
