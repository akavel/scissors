File: scan_dependencies.lua

A utility script, which scans a specified Lua script for its dependencies
(by recursively finding the modules loaded with the 'require' function).

Note: the script uses a very simple algorithm for finding the 'require'
function calls, so don't expect it to work with anything but simple strings
passed to 'require'. Note also that commented out 'require' calls are not ommitted.

Usage: lua scan_dependencies.lua [--stdin] [SCANNED_FILE] [< OPTIONS_FILE] > DEPENDENCIES_FILE

If the first option is "--stdin", the options are loaded from OPTIONS_FILE,
and SCANNED_FILE option is ignored.

Available options:
 scannedFile = 'filename.lua'
  -- 'filename.lua' will be treated as SCANNED_FILE
 preloaded = { 'module1', 'module2' }
  -- modules 'module1' and 'module2' will be treated as already loaded and 
     won't be included in the dependencies list. Default: {}
 outputTemplate = 'deps = { %s\\n}'
  -- a template for the dependencies output. The %s is substituted with
     the dependency list. Default: '%s']]
        os.exit(1)

    if arg[1] == '--stdin' then
