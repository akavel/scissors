Function: findPackage(name, [, silent])

Looks through the 'package.path' trying to find a matching
file named 'name'.

Parameters:
 name - a string with the name of the package to find (rules
  are the same as for the 'require' function, but only Lua
  modules are searched -- i.e. the 'package.path').
 silent - (optional) if set to true, no messages are printed
  by the function during the search.

Example:
> path = assert( findPackage( "loop.simple", "/" ) )
> print('Package "loop.simple" found at: " .. path)

See Also: 
 the 'require()' function in Lua.
