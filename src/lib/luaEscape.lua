Function: string.luaEscape(s)
Converts a string to an escaped form, which can be pasted
into Lua code.

Note:
 A shorter version is possible:
 > function string.luaEscape(s)
 >   return string.format('%q',s)
 > end
 but seems not to be working well with 'wxluafreeze', which
 unfortunately seems to perform some internationalization-like
 transformations on the code it loads.
