scenario:
1. start the Scissors Viewer
2. open the Windows Task Manager (Ctrl-Shift-Esc), find 'scissors.exe'
3. note how much memory is used by the process
4. load a big XML file (~200 KB) to Scissors
5. check how much memory is used by the process
6. load a small XML file (~10 KB, e.g. 'multilib.bkl')
7. check how much memory is used by the process - OBSERVATION: the memory usage is close to the value from step 5., while we'd expect it to be close to the value from step 3.
